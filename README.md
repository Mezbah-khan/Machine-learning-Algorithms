# Machine-learning-Algorithms
This repository contains a collection of machine learning algorithms implemented from scratch or using popular libraries such as Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Keras. It covers both traditional supervised learning techniques (e.g., Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees) and unsupervised methods (e.g., K-Means Clustering, PCA). Additionally, the repo includes foundational models in deep learning and reinforcement learning.

Key Features:
Supervised Learning: Implementations of regression, classification, and ensemble methods.
Unsupervised Learning: Clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection algorithms.
Deep Learning: Neural networks, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).
Reinforcement Learning: Basics of reinforcement learning models and environments.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Explore methods like Grid Search and Randomized Search for model optimization.
Each algorithm is demonstrated with sample code and real-world examples, allowing users to gain hands-on experience. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn machine learning or an advanced user building complex models, this repository has something to offer.
